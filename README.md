# directory-file-manager

This Bash script allows you to add or remove files in a directory and its subdirectories, except for excluded directories. It is useful for managing files in large directory structures when you want to add or remove files in multiple subdirectories at once. 
The script uses the "rsync" command to add files and the "rm" command to remove files. It also supports verbose mode to show details of each action. The script is easy to use and can be customized to suit your needs.
